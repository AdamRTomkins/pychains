Exploration in Python blockchains

This is a naive implementation of a Proof-of-Work blockchain, based heavily on https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46.

This is for educational purposes only and is expected to have copious bugs, faults, and inefficiencies. 

## Currently in place:
1. Blockchain structure
2. Proof of work mechanism
3. Simple "Longest chain" Consensus mechanism. 
4. REST API for adding transactions and triggering block mining

## TODO:
1. Naive block propagation
2. Smart block propagation
3. Port to Crossbar, maybe.
4. Stand alone, miner.
5. Simple Wallet Implementation
6. Simple coin and resource checking.
